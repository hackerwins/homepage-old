## Agent

Agent is a typical server. Agent receives changes from Client, stores them in DB, and propagates the changes to Clients who subscribe to the Document.

### Getting started

#### Install pre-built binaries

The easiest way to install yorkie is from pre-built binaries:

1. Download the compressed archive file for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/releases).
2. Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.
3. Add the executable binaries to your path. For example, rename and/or move the binaries to a directory in your path (like /usr/local/bin), or add the directory created by the previous step to your path.
4. From a shell, test that yorkie is in your path:
```bash
$ yorkie --version
Yorkie: {{site.version}}
...
```

#### Commands (CLI)

Yorkie is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Yorkie is only a single command-line application: `yorkie`. This application then takes a subcommand such as `agent`.

The yorkie CLI is a well-behaved command line application. In erroneous cases, a non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to `-h` and `---help` as you'd most likely expect.

To get help for any specific command, pass the `-h` flag to the relevant subcommand. For example, to see help about the members subcommand:

```bash
$ yorkie agent -h
Starts yorkie agent

Usage:
  yorkie agent [options] [flags]

Flags:
      --auth-webhook-cache-auth-ttl duration      TTL value to set when caching authorized webhook response. (default 10s)
      --auth-webhook-cache-size int               The cache size of the authorization webhook. (default 5000)

      --mongo-connection-timeout duration         Mongo DB's connection timeout (default 5s)
      --mongo-connection-uri string               MongoDB's connection URI
      --mongo-ping-timeout duration               Mongo DB's ping timeout (default 5s)

      --rpc-port int                              RPC port (default 11101)
```

#### Running Agent

Next, let's start a Yorkie agent. Agent runs until they're told to quit and handle the communication of maintenance tasks of Agent. and start the agent:

```bash
$ yorkie agent

backend created: id: c6ljcdl94818baveba8g, rpc: localhost:11101: db: memory
serving profiling on 11102
serving RPC on 11101
```

Agent store its data using an in-memory DB that does not provide durability by default.

### Running Agent with MongoDB

If you start an Agent with MongoDB address, you can permanently save the data stored by Yorkie.

*To start MongoDB, `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` in [the project root](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie).*

Then start a Yorkie agent with `--mongo-connection-uri` flag to connect the MongoDB.

```bash
$ yorkie agent --mongo-connection-uri mongodb://localhost:27017

MongoDB connected, URI: mongodb://localhost:27017, DB: yorkie-meta
backend created: id: c6ljibt948102kkt9neg, rpc: localhost:11101: db: mongodb://localhost:27017
serving profiling on 11102
serving RPC on 11101
```
